# SIS-750-Codebook
This is a codebook describing a merged dataset from PRIO as part of an assignment for my Data Analysis course at SIS in Spring 2023. This assignment asked us to collect data and make a useable codebook that references the specific dataset we created.

My project looks at the relationship between democratization and violence around elections. I gathered data from wherever. I did, A, B, and C to clean it. 

Files for the project: 
- `mydata.csv` replication data
- `slidescript.Rmd` code for creating the slides 
- `index.html` with the output 

**See the slides** on gh-pages [at this link](https://ayeazel.github.io/SIS-750-Codebook/#1)
